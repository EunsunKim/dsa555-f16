dsa555-f16
==========

This is repo contains class examples for students in dsa555 in fall 2016 at Seneca College.  You can view the examples in the browser, but you can also have your own local copy which will allow you to modify and play with the code.

To get the code contained here (unix commands here... if you are using a client, you're on your own).

First time (do this only the first time).  
----------------------------------------

* bring up a unix terminal (matrix, mac terminal, git bash... choice depends on your machine)
* Go to the directory where you would like your code examples for this class to go (if you want it at top level, skip this step)
* type: git clone https://github.com/SENECA-DSA555/dsa555-f16.git

This will create a directory called dsa555-f16 in your current directory.  Go into that for code updates

All other times (to update after class):
----------------

* go into the dsa555-f16 directory
* type: git pull origin
